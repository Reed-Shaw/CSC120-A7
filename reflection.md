Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
*Library*
- I overloaded the checkOut method so that a person could check out two books instead of just one. This is helpful if someone wants to check out more than one book at a time. I guess the next step for that sort of thing would be to make a limit on how many books one can check out (like at an actual library) and then have overloaded methods for each possible number of books one could check out. Unless theres a more efficient way to do it?
- I overloaded the returnBook method so that a person could return two books at a time instead of just one. This is helpful if onesome wants to return more than one book at a time. 
*Cafe*
- I overloaded the sellCoffee method so someone could just ask for a coffee without having to give a real order and they would just get a standard coffee (which here is 16oz, 2 cream, 2 sugar). 
- I overloaded the Cafe constructor so you could set up a cafe without having to input any information about it. 
*House*
- I overloaded the moveIn method so that a list of student residents could be added at once. This would make it easier to add a lot of students to the house at a time. 
- I overloaded the House constructor so that you only have to input the name of the house without any other information. So if the using doesn't know the rest of the information they can still make a house. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

If you struggle thinking in an object-oriented way, now is the time to really work on that. This was relatively straightforward for me (which is wild to think about seeing as I could not have imagined doing any of this at the start of the semester!!). Taking the whole assignment one step at a time was really helpful for me. There's a lot of code and different classes in one assignment now so it was important for me to work on making changes one class at a time. Trying to do too much at once (ex. think about which methods to overload for several classes at the same time) just got me confused.
